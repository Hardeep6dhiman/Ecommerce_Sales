# Ecommerce_Sales


## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to analyze eCommerce sales data and provide key insights into sales performance, profitability, regional sales distribution, and category-wise contributions. The dashboard is designed to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions by offering a comprehensive view of year-over-year (YOY) growth in sales, profits, orders, and quantity sold. It highlights trends, sales and profit by region and category, and the top-performing subcategories.
